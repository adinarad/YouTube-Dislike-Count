# Youtube Dislike Count
A Chrome extension that adds the dislikes:thumbsdown: count back to your [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
> This extension uses YouTube Data API to get the dislikes count. Add your API Key to use the extension.

> As of December 13, 2021, YouTube has made *statistics.dislikeCount* property private. This means that the property is included in an API response only if the API request was authenticated by the video owner. Hence, this extension may stop working. I'll update it with a different API whenever I get time.

## Note
> As of Nov 10, 2021, YouTube made the dislikes count private across the complete platform. You can read more about it [here](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-to-youtube/).
